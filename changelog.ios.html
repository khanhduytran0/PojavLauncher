     <h2>System Support in future releases</h2>
     crystall1nedev: We've made some amazing advancements in the past few months with the launcher, however this announcement is for something else. I revisited an old conversation with Duy about iOS version support in PojavLauncher iOS. After digging into the facts, such as feature parity, the userbase, and the user experience, we have come to the following conclusion:<br>
<br>
In a future release, PojavLauncher will <b>require iOS 14.0 or later.</b><br>
You can learn more about how this will happen over time with the GitHub issue linked <a href="https://github.com/PojavLauncherTeam/PojavLauncher_iOS/issues/384">here</a>
<br>
      <h2>PojavLauncher iOS: Non-jailbroken devices, Java 17, "Shulk Catalyst", and more</h2>
      <p>crystall1nedev: We've gotten pretty far with unjailbroken PojavLauncher in the past few days thanks to DuyKhanhTran's brilliance, and we are planning for 2.1 of the launcher to include an unjailbroken package! However, I just want to say a few things:<span id="dots">...</span><span id="more">
        <br>
      <br>  
          <b>â€¢ PojavLauncher 2.1 will be coming after Java 17 is brought to unjailbroken devices</b>.<br> We want to include unjailbroken builds as soon as possible to reach even more users!<br>
      
          <b>â€¢ 2.1 will also be the last version to include .deb packages**</b>.</br> Sideloading the ipa when jailbroken has all of the features you know--as well as a new directory system from the native Files app! Because of the feature parity when jailbroken, there's no need to include a special jailbroken package, and we will not be providing one with PojavLauncher 2.2 or later.
          <br>
          â€¢ On jailbroken devices, AppSync Unified can be used to install the .ipa without an Apple ID.<br>
          â€¢ If you want to use when unjailbroken as well, you can still sideload with AltStore or ReProvision.<br>
      <br>
          <b>My repository will no longer host PojavLauncher or OpenJDK</b>.<br> My repository won't be hosting anything, actually, as I'm going to be completely shutting it down. After PojavLauncher 2.1 is released, I recommend getting used to the sideloading method via AppSync or AltStore. I'll be making an AltStore repository to make things easier for updating after my repo goes dark.</span></p>

     If your device has only 1GB RAM (total), it might able to boot Minecraft to main screen, but might not able to join worlds or servers due to too little RAM.
